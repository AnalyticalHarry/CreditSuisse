Credit Suisse is a Swiss multinational investment bank and financial services company that was founded in 1856. The company has a long history of providing banking and financial services to individuals, corporations, and governments around the world.
In recent years, Credit Suisse has been facing significant financial problems, which have put pressure on the global banking system. One of the key issues has been the recent takeover of Credit Suisse by its larger rival UBS, which resulted in the investment of bondholders being wiped out. The bondholders who owned about $17 billion of risky Credit Suisse debt were left with nothing after the takeover.
The problem at Credit Suisse centers around the hierarchy of who should lose out first when a bank struggles. On one hand, investors who bought risky AT1 bonds (Additional Tier 1 bank debt) should expect to lose money when a bank runs into trouble. However, there are questions because Credit Suisse’s shareholders will not be wiped out completely but are set to be compensated in the emergency takeover with UBS shares worth the equivalent of Sfr 0.76 (£0.67) a share.
AT1 bonds, also known as Additional Tier 1 bonds, are a type of debt instrument issued by banks to raise capital. They are hybrid securities that combine characteristics of both bonds and equity, and are designed to increase the safety buffers of banks in times of financial stress. If a bank's capital levels fall below a certain level, the AT1 bonds can be converted into equity, which helps to reduce the bank's debts and increase its capitalization. These bonds were introduced after the 2008 financial crisis as a way to "bail in" failing banks, by imposing losses on investors rather than relying on taxpayer-funded bailouts. As a result, AT1 bonds are considered riskier than other types of debt, and investors are typically offered a higher return to compensate for this risk.
